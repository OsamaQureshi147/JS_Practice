1. The call() method invokes a function with a given this value as a first parameter and rest of the arguments as it is.
2. The apply() method works same as call() method, the only difference is that we send arguments as an array in apply() method.
3. Unlike call() and apply(), bind() returns you a new function with binded this object.
